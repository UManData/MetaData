Note that the first number in this file is the number of holes or positions;
the second number is the diameter of the disk in mm or whatever units the x,y are expressed in.
The following pairs of numbers are the x,y positions of each hole, given in millimeters or an arbitrary unit,
and expressed relative to the center of the disk.
Normal cartesian coordinates are used for the sign of x and y.
Commas between x and y are required. 
The number of pairs must be equal to the number of holes, of course.
